### Introduction

In October 2024, I received an unexpected call from a former colleague asking for advice on applying to graduate school for data science. I gave her my honest opinion—I wasn’t sure if I had made the right decision in joining the University of British Columbia’s Master of Data Science (MDS) program. Looking back, I wish I had told her to call me again after a few more months of trial and error. Now, I’m ready to share my experience and what I’ve learned as a person of color pursuing a master’s degree in UBC’s MDS program.

### Who Am I? 

My name is Merari Santana-Carbajal. I’m 29 years old and was born in Southern California. I am the daughter of two Mexican immigrant parents and the first in my family to graduate from a four-year college. I studied general biology at the University of California, San Diego, graduating in 2017. Shortly after, I worked in various labs performing DNA sequencing for cancer research. 

Although I enjoyed my work, I noticed that vast amounts of data were being generated but remained unanalyzed. This sparked my interest in data science, and I spent several years contemplating a return to school. When I first came across the UBC Master of Data Science [program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/vancouver), I was immediately drawn to its short, 10-month structure and its acceptance of students from non-technical backgrounds. So, I decided to apply. When I received my acceptance letter, I was elated and ready to embark on this new chapter of my life. 

### MDS Program Structure

UBC’s MDS program consists of six blocks and a final capstone project. Each block lasts about a month and includes four courses. Every week, students attend two lectures per course and complete a comprehensive lab assignment for each class. 

In the third week of each block, quizzes are given to test the students' knowledge. During this same week, students are simultaneously learning new material and working on lab assignments. After the fourth week, final quizzes assess the content from the last two weeks.
