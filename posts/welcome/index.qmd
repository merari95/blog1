Introduction: 

In October 2024, I received an unexpected call from a former colleague asking for advice on applying to graduate school for data science. I gave her my honest opinion—I wasn’t sure if I had made the right decision in joining the University of British Columbia’s Master of Data Science (MDS) program. Looking back, I wish I had told her to call me again after a few more months of trial and error. Now, I’m ready to share my experience and what I’ve learned as a person of color pursuing a master’s degree in UBC’s MDS program.
