### Introduction

In October 2024, I received an unexpected call from a former colleague asking for advice on applying to graduate school for data science. I gave her my honest opinion—I wasn’t sure if I had made the right decision in joining the University of British Columbia’s Master of Data Science (MDS) program. Looking back, I wish I had told her to call me again after a few more months of trial and error. Now, I’m ready to share my experience and what I’ve learned as a person of color pursuing a master’s degree in UBC’s MDS program.

### Who Am I? 

My name is Merari Santana-Carbajal. I’m 29 years old and was born in Southern California. I am the daughter of two Mexican immigrant parents and the first in my family to graduate from a four-year college. I studied general biology at the University of California, San Diego, graduating in 2017. Shortly after, I worked in various labs performing DNA sequencing for cancer research. 

Although I enjoyed my work, I noticed that vast amounts of data were being generated but remained unanalyzed. This sparked my interest in data science, and I spent several years contemplating a return to school. When I first came across the UBC Master of Data Science [program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/vancouver), I was immediately drawn to its short, 10-month structure and its acceptance of students from non-technical backgrounds. So, I decided to apply. When I received my acceptance letter, I was elated and ready to embark on this new chapter of my life. 

### MDS Program Structure

UBC’s MDS program consists of six blocks and a final capstone project. Each block lasts about a month and includes four courses. Every week, students attend two lectures per course and complete a comprehensive lab assignment for each class. 

In the third week of each block, quizzes are given to test the students' knowledge. During this same week, students are simultaneously learning new material and working on lab assignments. After the fourth week, final quizzes assess the content from the last two weeks.

### My Challenges

It’s easy to imagine how stressful this environment can be, especially after being out of school for seven years. Being 1,839 kilometers away from my family was another challenge, and my limited computational skills didn’t help. I had taken an introductory Python course, but that was the extent of my coding knowledge. I constantly battled imposter syndrome and felt inadequate. 

Additionally, I suffer from an anxiety disorder, and managing all these changes at once was extremely difficult. I began isolating myself from my peers and, every week, I felt like dropping out of the program. After discussing my concerns with my parents, I decided to wait until the end of the first block to assess my progress. I promised myself I would do my best, and if I failed any classes, I would withdraw from the program. 

### Growth 

To my surprise, I passed all my classes with good grades. While this was encouraging, I was still experiencing a lot of anxiety. At the start of Block 3, I scheduled a meeting with one of the MDS program directors to voice my concerns and develop a better study plan. Fortunately, the MDS staff are incredibly approachable, and this individual was very receptive. Together, we devised a new study strategy and explored mental health resources (see [How to Succeed in MDS](#how-to-succeed-in-mds).)

Instead of taking detailed notes before lectures and trying to absorb every aspect of a topic all at once, I began reading the lecture notes more casually. During lectures and after completing lab assignments, I reinforced the main ideas. If I had any questions, I reached out to professors for clarification. I also started attending my lab section more regularly to get help with assignments. Additionally, I took advantage of professors’ weekly office hours. 

I realized that the goal of MDS isn’t to get straight A’s but to develop a solid understanding of core data science principles. If you complete the lab assignments, study for quizzes, and put in the effort, you will pass the courses. 

In addition to improving my study habits, I started receiving mental health counseling to better manage my anxiety. I incorporated exercise breaks into my study routine and dedicated one day per week—after finishing my lab assignments—to completely disconnect from academic work. I focused on taking things one day at a time. To stay motivated, I created an affirmation board to remind myself of my goals and why I was pursuing this degree. 

After the two-week winter break, I returned to school with a shifted mindset: instead of wondering *if*  I would graduate, I told myself *when* I graduate.

### How to Succeed in MDS

If you are considering or currently enrolled in the MDS program, here are some key strategies to help you succeed: 

Mentally prepare for the intensity – The MDS program is a rigorous data science curriculum compressed into 10 months. The first few weeks will be the hardest as you adjust to the fast-paced workflow. 

Strengthen your coding skills beforehand – If you don’t have a technical background, I highly recommend taking Python courses. Here’s a great beginner’s [Python bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) available at a set price. Another [Python resource](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) is accessible for free. 

Use MDS resources – The MDS Slack channel (see @fig-slack) is a great tool for communicating with peers and professors. 

Seek help early – Attend office hours if you need clarification on topics. Lab sections are also valuable for getting additional assistance from professors and teaching assistants. 

Plan your assignments – If you like to organize your tasks, you can use GitHub’s [Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)  (see @fig-github) to manage your schedule. 

Prioritize your mental health – If you struggle with mental health, visit [UBC’s mental health resources](https://students.ubc.ca/health/counselling-services/mental-health-care-ubc/) for support. Take study breaks and dedicate one day per week to relaxation to prevent burnout. 

Collaborate with peers – Working with classmates is an effective way to consolidate information and improve your understanding of key concepts. 

Reach out to student representatives – The MDS program has student reps for mental health, international students, social activities, and more. Don’t hesitate to contact them for support. 

Communicate with professors – If you’re struggling with the material, talk to your professors about strategies for improvement. They are there to help you succeed. 

Stay consistent – Attend classes, complete your work, and put in your best effort. If you do this, you will succeed in the program.

### Conclusion

If you are struggling in MDS, remember that you are not alone. Most students face similar challenges, even if they don’t openly talk about them. Take advantage of the resources provided by UBC and the MDS program. 

If I have the opportunity to speak with my former colleague again, I will tell her with confidence: I made the right decision to study in MDS. Anything worthwhile requires hard work.
