    "text": "Introduction:\nIn October 2024, I received an unexpected call from a former colleague asking for advice on applying to graduate school for data science. I gave her my honest opinion—I wasn’t sure if I had made the right decision in joining the University of British Columbia’s Master of Data Science (MDS) program. Looking back, I wish I had told her to call me again after a few more months of trial and error. Now, I’m ready to share my experience and what I’ve learned as a person of color pursuing a master’s degree in UBC’s MDS program.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Photo of me on orientation day. Image by Author\n\n\n\n\nWho Am I?\nMy name is Merari Santana-Carbajal. I’m 29 years old and was born in Southern California. I am the daughter of two Mexican immigrant parents and the first in my family to graduate from a four-year college. I studied general biology at the University of California, San Diego, graduating in 2017. Shortly after, I worked in various labs performing DNA sequencing for cancer research.\nAlthough I enjoyed my work, I noticed that vast amounts of data were being generated but remained unanalyzed. This sparked my interest in data science, and I spent several years contemplating a return to school. When I first came across the UBC Master of Data Science [website] (https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/vancouver), I was immediately drawn to its short, 10-month structure and its acceptance of students from non-technical backgrounds. So, I decided to apply. When I received my acceptance letter, I was elated and ready to embark on this new chapter of my life."
